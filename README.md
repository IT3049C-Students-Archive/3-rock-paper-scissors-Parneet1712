## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 20
I know I submitted it a day late but I do have one free thing for assignmnents left, so that is why, i gave 20.

## Self-Reflection:
I have learnt many new things about javScript as I a new to it.
I know I submitted it late but i tried to finish almost all the tasks of the assignment 
I learnt how to fix errors from the tests.


### How long it took me to finish this?
It too me about 20-22 hours. This happened because as i said I am new to JavaScript all the test things, so I did not knew that I was supposed to follow the instructions. That took a lot of time.
